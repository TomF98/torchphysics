    "In this example we a solve a obstacle PDE. The special point in this example are the inequalyties in the corresponding differentialequation. On the unit square $\\Omega = (0, 1) \\times (0, 1)$, we consider the problem:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    -\\Delta u &= 0.01 \\text{ in } \\Omega \\\\\n",
    "    u &= 0 \\text{ on } \\Gamma_D \\\\\n",
    "    \\vec{n} \\nabla u &= 0 \\text{ on } \\Gamma_N \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "The condition $u -g \\geq 0$ sets the contact, $-\\vec{n} \\nabla u \\leq 0$ implies that the solution can extract a force on the obstacle not the other way around. The last complementary condition ensures, that we can only apply a force when there is a contact, otherwise the normal derivative has to be zero.\n",
